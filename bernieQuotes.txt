A nation will not survive morally or economically when so few have so much and so many have so little.
The problems we face, did not come down from the heavens. They are made, they are made by bad human decisions, and good human decisions can change them.
Finally, lets understand that when we stand together, we will always win. When men and women stand together for justice, we win. When black, white and Hispanic people stand together for justice, we win.
What my campaign is about is a political revolution - millions of people standing up and saying, enough is enough. Our government belongs to all of us, and not just the hand full of billionaires.
Real change never occurs from the top on down, [but] always from the bottom on up.
Now is the time to alter our government. Now is the time to stop the movement toward oligarchy. Now is the time to create a government which represents all Americans and not just the 1%... No more excuses. We must all become involved in the political process.
The struggle to create a nation and world of economic and social justice and environmental sanity is not an easy one. The struggle to try and create a more peaceful world will be extremely difficult. But this I know: despair is not an option if we care about our kids and grandchildren. Giving up is not an option if we want to prevent irreparable harm to our planet.
We do not need to have a president who insults Mexicans and Latinos and Muslims and women and veterans and African-Americans, we need a president who brings us together, not divides us up.
It's better to show up than to give up.
Americans' right to free speech should not be proportionate to their bank accounts.
The only way change happens is when people become more significantly involved in the political process.
Today, the top one-tenth of 1% owns nearly as much wealth as the bottom 90%. The economic game is rigged, and this level of inequality is unsustainable. We need an economy that works for all, not just the powerful.
An America where every person, no matter their race, their disability or their sexual orientation realizes the full promise of equality that is our birthright as Americans.
Income and wealth inequality have reached obscene levels, the threat of climate change is more frightening than ever, and the billionaire class is now allowed to spend unlimited amounts of money to buy the candidate they want. And it is up to us to stand up and fight back. If we stand together, there is no limit to what we can accomplish.
What kind of nation are we when we give tax breaks to billionaires, but we can't take care of the elderly and the children.
I am going to do my best to try to create a country in which children are not living in poverty, in which kids can go to college, in which old people have health care. Will I succeed? I can't guarantee you that, but I can tell you that from a human point of view it is better to show up than to give up.
When millions of people stand up and fight...they win.
The point is change can come about, but it only comes about when millions of people are actively involved in political struggle, the billionaires may have the money, but we have the people.
All I can say is if you check my record going back a long time, I have stood with those who are hurting. I have stood with those who have no money.
It costs a hell of a lot more money to put somebody in jail than send them to the University of Virginia.
If the environment were a bank, it would have been saved by now.
The greed of the billionaire class has got to end and we are going to end it for them.
If you can't afford to take care of your veterans , then don't go to war.
We need to change the power structure in America, we need to end the political oligarchy.
Nobody who works 40 hours a week should be living in poverty.
Brothers and sisters: Now is not the time for thinking small, now is not the time for the same-old, same-old establishment politics and stale inside-the-Beltway ideas.
I think what the American people are saying is enough is enough. This country, this great country, belongs to all of us. It cannot continue to be controlled by a handful of billionaires who apparently want it all.
Politics is not a baseball game with winners or losers. What politics is about is whether we protect the needs of millions of people in the country who are hurting.
Let us wage a moral and political war against war itself, so that we can cut military spending and use that money for human needs.
You know, I think many people have the mistaken impression that Congress regulates Wall Street. In truth that's not the case. The real truth is that Wall Street regulates the Congress.
